              They need to take seven and they might take yours. Any self-respecting demon should be living in a pit of filth or a nice crypt.
              Who's calling me? Everybody I know lives here. Can't even shout, can't even cry. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control 
              and turn into an enormous green rage monster. I wanna hurt you, but I can't resist the sinister attraction of your cold and muscular 
              body! In their resting state, our actives are as innocent and vulnerable as children.
